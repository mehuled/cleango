# cleango
A short program to learn principles of Clean Code with golang.

## Problem Statement

One fine day, you had to build a `Go` module that generates a summary of a provided directory, however you were told that such a module already exists but the the problem is that it is not written in the best way possible. It works and provides the required functionality (or we hope so!) however its a complete `NO!` to get this to production.

Since you are running on a tight timeline, you can't really start re-writing the whole thing from scratch but you can go ahead and make fixes to this code to make it Production ready!

Also you were able dig out the requirement document for this code and it looks like the following:

1. Takes as input a command line argument `--dir` which is a absolute path to a directory in the host file system.
2. It traverses over the files in the dir (excluding the hidden files).
3. Generates a summary of the directory in a J
4.


You are expected to refactor this code using the Clean Code principles and raise a PR with your changes.

### Instructions
1. Please keep your branch name as your Github username.
2. You are free to add files, test cases, edge cases, comments to the code as long as you are making it better.
3. Make sure that the modified code works as expected by the requirements document.


That's all! Go ahead, `git` started!
